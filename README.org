  - Test::Exception

** History
*** Version 0.1
*** Version 0.2
*** Version 0.3
  - no protein/nucleic acid parameter is nessesary
*** Version 0.4
  - Support for merged TaxIDs
  - for non exstisting gis links to history tool of NCBI will be
    returned
*** Version 0.5
  - first version compatible to the CPAN standards. Template was
    created using h2xs v1.23 with options:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    -d -XA -n NCBI::Taxonomy
    #+END_SRC
    - I fixed the files Changes, README, MANIFEST, but the whole module
    files will be changed in the next version
*** Version 0.51
  - I moved the old module TaxonomyByGi to my new module
          NCBI::Taxonomy and changed the files Changes and README. I
          did not add documentation.
  - added the file Changes to the version control (I forgot to add it ;) )
  - TODOs:
    - no tests writen
    - have to fill the documentation
    - I want to add the functions to download and prepare the
          index-files
*** Version 0.511
  - added a handling for GIs which could not be found in the
    index-file and had no substitution comment inside the Genbank
    Entry
*** Version 0.52
  - added a handler for download errors caused by NCBI requests
*** Version 0.60.0
  - A new version which uses a binary file type for storing the gi and taxid information.
*** Version 0.61.1853
  - Switched to Log::Log4perl for messages and added croak commands for failing IO calls!
*** Version 0.62.1854
  - I am using a ring buffer to save 6000 lineages for taxids to speed
    up the finding of the lineages.
*** Version 0.63.*
  - Implementation of a last common ancestor
**** Version 0.63.1863
  - Include last common ancestor calculations now
*** Version 0.64.1868
  - Fixed the LCA on request of Felix... A new parameter was added and
    an empty result array reference will be returned, if less than 2
    lineages are compared.
*** Version 0.70.3
  - Included the new format for the nodes and removed the subroutines
    which were necessary for the import of the dmp files.
*** Version 0.70.5
  - Added data for creation of a DB and therefore enabling test
    functionality. Moreover, the untested function getLCAbyGIs dies on
    execution. To avoid this, the variable

    #+BEGIN_SRC perl
    $no_die_on_untested_functions
    #+END_SRC

    can be set to a true value on line 18!
*** Version 0.80.0
  - First version available on [[https://github.com/greatfireball/NCBI-Taxonomy][GitHub]]
  - Added a licence file and a org-mode based readme file
  - Badges for build and coverage are added
